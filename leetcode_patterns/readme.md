## Extremely useful patterns for solving more than 90% leetcode problems

* if the input array is sorted:

  * Binary search
  * Two pointers
* if asked for all permutations/subsets:

  * Backtracking
* if given a tree:

  * DFS
  * BFS
* if given a graph:

  * DFS
  * BFS
* if given a linked list:

  * Two pointers
* if recursion is banned:

  * Stack
* if must solve in-place:

  * Swap corresponding values
  * Store one or more different values in the same pointer
* if asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset

  * Dynamic programming
* if asked for the top/least K** **

  * Heap
* if asked for common** **

  * Map
  * Trie
* else:

  * Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
  * Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
